We all have seen lots of articles where Reinforcement Learning (LR) agents have been used to cross frozen lakes, climb mountains, choosing the best routes for a cab in a city, etc.  Games present a significant challenge to real-life agents since they require us to make several decisions. Normally, we must optimize these decisions in order to improve our overall score (or not to fall down a hole in the frozen lake, otherwise we can get troubles). Games also show how the math behind agents works in a beautiful way. However, RL isn't about playing games; it's about developing agents who can make decisions on their own.
